                    During the times when Yeesh used the Dmitry Yazov profile picture, he joined in a lot of aoh2 discords, and also didn't pretended to become a weeb, at those times he met people in Terrk's server and Winnie's server, that was also the time where he became moderator for the first time, on Winnie's server, with the role given by Dolphin (the owner of the website :troll:).
