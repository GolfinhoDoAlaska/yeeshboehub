                    During the times when Yeesh used a catboy pfp (actually those are recent times) Yeesh became moderator in Terrk's server, this made him a sort of "only non-1984 mod in terrk's server", compared to other moderators, he was the nicest one (not punishing too hard and also being cool). At this time, AoI released too, so Yeesh had stuff to play in his potato cellphone.
